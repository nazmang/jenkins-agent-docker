# jenkins-agent-docker

This repository contains custom Jenkins agent with new Docker binaries because native [jnlp-agent-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-agent-docker) contains old 18.x version which prevents the use of new docker-compose file versions.

## Installation

Create a job with Pipeline somewhere in your Jenkins instance.
